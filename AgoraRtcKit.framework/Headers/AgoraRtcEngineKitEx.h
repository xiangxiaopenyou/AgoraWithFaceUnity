@interface AgoraRtcEngineKit(Ex)

/**
 * Joins a channel.
 *
 * Users in the same channel can talk to each other, and multiple users in the
 * same channel can start a group chat. Users with different App IDs cannot
 * call each other even if they join the same channel.
 *
 * You must call the {@link leaveChannel: leaveChannel} method to exit the
 * current call before entering another channel. This method call is
 * asynchronous; therefore, you can call this method in the main user interface
 * thread.
 *
 * A successful method call triggers the following callbacks:
 *
 * - The local client: {@link AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.rtcEngine:didJoinChannel:withUid:elapsed: didJoinChannel}.
 * - The remote client: {@link AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.rtcEngine:didJoinedOfUid:elapsed: didJoinedOfUid},
 * if the user joining the channel is in the Communication profile, or is a
 * BROADCASTER in the Live Broadcast profile.
 *
 * When the connection between the client and Agora's server is interrupted due
 * to poor network conditions, the SDK tries reconnecting to the server. When
 * the local client successfully rejoins the channel, the SDK triggers the {@link AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.rtcEngine:didRejoinChannel:withUid:elapsed: didRejoinChannel} callback on the local client.
 *
 * @note
 * - When joining a channel, the SDK calls
 * `setCategory(AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord)` to set `AVAudioSession`
 * to `PlayAndRecord` mode. When `AVAudioSession` is set to `PlayAndRecord`
 * mode, the sound played (for example a ringtone) is interrupted. The app
 * should not set `AVAudioSession` to any other mode.
 * - The SDK uses the iOS's AVAudioSession shared object for audio recording
 * and playback. Using this object may affect the SDK’s audio functions.
 * @param token The token for authentication.
 * - In situations not requiring high security: You can use the temporary token
 * generated at Console. For details, see [Get a temporary token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-a-temporary-token).
 * - In situations requiring high security: Set it as the token generated at
 * you server. For details, see [Generate a token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/token?platform=All%20Platforms#get-a-token).
 * @param channelId Unique channel name for the AgoraRTC session in the string
 * format. The string length must be less than 64 bytes. Supported character
 * scopes are:
 * - All lowercase English letters: a to z.
 * - All uppercase English letters: A to Z.
 * - All numeric characters: 0 to 9.
 * - The space character.
 * - Punctuation characters and other symbols, including: "!", "#", "$", "%", "&", "(", ")", "+", "-", ":", ";", "<", "=", ".", ">", "?", "@", "[", "]", "^", "_", " {", "}", "|", "~", ",".
 * @param info (Optional) Additional information about the channel. This
 * parameter can be set to `nil` or contain channel related information. Other
 * users in the channel do not receive this message.
 * @param uid User ID. A 32-bit unsigned integer with a value ranging from 1 to
 * (2<sup>32</sup>-1). The `uid` must be unique. If a `uid` is not assigned (or
 * set to 0), the SDK assigns and returns a `uid` in the callback. Your app
 * must record and maintain the returned `uid` since the SDK does not do so.
 * @param connectionId pointer to connection ID, out param
 * @param mediaOptions AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions Object.
 * @param joinSuccessBlock Same as {@link AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.rtcEngine:didJoinChannel:withUid:elapsed: didJoinChannel}. We recommend you set this parameter as `nil` to use `didJoinChannel`.
 * - If `joinSuccessBlock` is nil, the SDK triggers the `didJoinChannel` callback.
 * - If you implement both `joinSuccessBlock` and `didJoinChannel`, `joinSuccessBlock` takes higher priority than `didJoinChannel`.
 *
 * @return
 * - 0: Success.
 * - < 0: Failure.

/**
 * Leaves the channel.
 *
 * This method allows a user to leave the channel, for example, by hanging up or

 *
 * This method also releases all resources related to the call.
 *
 * This method is an asynchronous call, which means that the result of this
 * method returns before the user has not actually left the channel. Once
 * the user successfully leaves the channel, the SDK triggers the
 * {@link AgoraRtcEngineDelegate.rtcEngine:didLeaveChannelWithStats: didLeaveChannelWithStats} callback.
 *
 * @note
 * - If you call {@link destroy} immediately after this method, the leaveChannel
 * process is interrupted, and the SDK does not trigger the
 * `didLeaveChannelWithStats` callback.
 * - When you call this method, the SDK deactivates the audio session on iOS by
 * default, and may affect other apps.

/** Binds the remote user to the video display window, that is, sets the view for the user of the specified uid.

 Usually, the application should specify the uid of the remote video in the method call before the user enters a channel. If the remote uid is unknown to the application, set it later when the application receives the [userJoinedBlock]([AgoraRtcEngineKit userJoinedBlock:]) event.
 If the Video Recording function is enabled, the Video Recording Service joins the channel as a dumb client, which means other clients will also receive the [didJoinedOfUid]([AgoraRtcEngineDelegate rtcEngine:didJoinedOfUid:elapsed:]) event. Your application should not bind it with the view, because it does not send any video stream. If your application cannot recognize the dumb client, bind it with the view when the [firstRemoteVideoDecodedOfUid]([AgoraRtcEngineDelegate rtcEngine:firstRemoteVideoDecodedOfUid:size:elapsed:]) event is triggered. To unbind the user with the view, set the view to null. After the user has left the channel, the SDK unbinds the remote user.
